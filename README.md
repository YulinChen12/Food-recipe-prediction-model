## Introduction  
In the realm of culinary arts and nutritional science, understanding the caloric content of food is fundamental. It informs dietary choices, aids in health management, and fuels gastronomic creativity. This project leverages the power of data analysis and machine learning to address a compelling question: Can we accurately predict the calorie count of a recipe based on its inherent characteristics? Our primary objective is to develop a predictive model capable of estimating the caloric content of recipes. This model aims to assist dietitians, culinary enthusiasts, and the general public in gauging the nutritional value of different recipes, fostering informed dietary choices. The ability to predict calorie counts from readily available recipe information could transform how we approach cooking and dietary planning.

Our approach encompasses several key stages:

1. Data Collection and Cleaning: Utilizing a dataset of recipes and user interactions, we meticulously clean and preprocess the data, ensuring a robust foundation for our analysis.

2. Feature Engineering: We derive insightful features from the data, focusing on those that are available before the recipe is prepared.

3. Predictive Modeling: Employing machine learning techniques, we build and refine models to predict caloric content. Our journey begins with a baseline model, which we iteratively improve to achieve enhanced accuracy.

4. Fairness Assessment: We conduct a fairness analysis to evaluate whether our model's performance is equitable across different recipe categories, ensuring ethical and unbiased results.
